/**
 * CortenaUI — Size Token
 *
 * Three component size tiers used throughout CortenaUI. Components read the active [SizeToken] from
 * the theme to determine their height, padding, icon size, and other dimensions.
 *
 * The three tiers are derived from a single anchor: [Medium]. [Small] is `Medium / √φ` and [Large]
 * is `Medium × √φ`, where φ is the golden ratio (≈ 1.618), so Small → Large spans a full φ.
 * Anchoring at Medium keeps existing components visually stable while giving Small and Large
 * mathematically grounded proportions.
 *
 * [Medium] is the default tier and matches all hardcoded component dimensions in the library,
 * ensuring zero visual regressions for current consumers.

/**
 * Sink that receives path commands emitted by the shape geometry builders in this module.
 *
 * The receiver pattern decouples the pure-Kotlin shape mathematics from any concrete graphics
 * framework. Consumers implement this interface to forward commands to their target path type:
 * - Compose consumers wrap `androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Path`.
 * - Android View / Canvas consumers wrap `android.graphics.Path`.
 * - SVG, Skia, or system-level renderers wrap their respective path APIs.
 *
 * All coordinates are in pixels in the destination coordinate space. The builders never call
 * `close()` more than once per call, and emit commands in the order: one [moveTo] followed by a
 * sequence of [lineTo] / [cubicTo] calls and a final [close].
